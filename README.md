# plgcleanup.org

Community Cleanup PLG — a static [Astro](https://astro.build) site for a Brooklyn
neighborhood cleanup group.
Live: **https://plgcleanup.pages.dev/** (Cloudflare Pages, auto-deploys on push to `main`).

The site is built to last with very little maintenance: a tiny dependency set, standard
Astro conventions, all content in plain Markdown, and dependencies that update themselves
via Dependabot PRs that CI checks before you merge.

## Editing the site (no coding needed)

Everything an organizer normally changes is plain text you can edit on GitHub (click a file,
click the ✏️ pencil, change the words, **Commit changes** — the site rebuilds itself). If an
edit has a mistake, the build fails and nothing broken goes live.

| To change…                                                       | Edit this                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The next cleanup's **date, time, place**                         | In [Pages CMS](#pages-cms-form-based-editing), open **Event details** — or edit `src/data/event.json` directly. Bad dates/times fail the build with a message naming the field. |
| **Statistics** (pounds collected, volunteer count)               | In [Pages CMS](#pages-cms-form-based-editing), open **Statistics** — or edit `src/data/stats.json` directly. Plain numbers, no commas.                                          |
| **FAQ / About / Terms / Agreements / Schedule** page text        | The matching file in `src/content/pages/` (e.g. `faq.md`). Write normal Markdown.                                                                                               |
| **Testimonials** in the home-page carousel                       | One file per person in `src/content/testimonials/` (e.g. `jaan.md`): the top block holds their name, quote, and photo; the text below is the full testimonial.                  |
| A testimonial **photo**                                          | Add the image to `src/assets/testimonials/` and point the person's `image:` at it.                                                                                              |
| **Site settings** (e.g. randomize the carousel order each build) | `src/config.ts` — flip a `true`/`false` toggle; each is documented in the file.                                                                                                 |

Prefer a form-based editor? See Pages CMS below — it edits these same files behind a friendly UI.

## Pages CMS (form-based editing)

[Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) gives non-technical editors a form UI for the **testimonials**,
the **prose pages**, the **event details**, and the **statistics** — all backed by the same plain
files git already tracks (`src/content/**`, `src/data/event.json`, `src/data/stats.json`). It's
configured in `.pages.yml`.

**Activate it (one-time):**

1. Sign in at [app.pagescms.org](https://app.pagescms.org) with GitHub.
2. Install the Pages CMS **GitHub App**, and scope the install to **only this repository** — the
   app requests broad permissions, so don't grant it your whole account.
3. Open the repo in Pages CMS; it reads `.pages.yml` and shows the editing forms.

Edits commit straight to `main` and Cloudflare Pages redeploys (see [Deployment & CI](#deployment--ci)).
Give it **40–60 seconds** after saving for the change to build and go live on the site — a refresh
before then still shows the old version. A bad edit fails the build, so the last good site stays live.

**Not locked in.** `.pages.yml` is a thin adapter over the content — the files stay plain
Markdown + JSON validated by Astro at build time. Swapping to another Astro-friendly CMS
(e.g. [Decap](https://decapcms.org), [Sveltia](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms)) means
writing that CMS's config against the same files; no content migration.

```

Page-specific CSS lives in a scoped `<style>` in its own page (`index.astro`, `join.astro`)
or component; only genuinely shared styles are global (`src/styles/`).

## How a few things work

- **Content Collections** (`src/content.config.ts`) validate every page and testimonial at
  build time — a missing photo or malformed field fails the build instead of shipping broken.
- **`event.ts`** is the single source of truth for the event. The editable facts live in
  `event.json` (edited via Pages CMS); `event.ts` validates them, parses the friendly date/time,
  handles New York daylight saving, and builds the "Get directions" map link. Running totals
  (pounds, volunteers) live in `stats.ts` / `stats.json`.
- **Live countdown** — `countdown.ts` turns the event time into the "in N days / tomorrow / this
  Saturday" copy (home hero, its CTA button, and `/join`). It's pure and dependency-free, so the
  same code runs at build time _and_ in the browser: `src/lib/countdown.client.ts` recomputes it on
  load (and every minute) from the event timestamps, so the wording is always right for the
  visitor's clock — the static HTML never goes stale between deploys, and no scheduled rebuild is
  needed.
- **Carousel** — Embla owns the scroll physics; a small state machine keeps exactly one slide
  highlighted ("last interaction wins"). Testimonial bodies are Markdown, rendered server-side.
- **Site chrome** — `SiteHeader` and `MobileMenu` render as siblings so the general-sibling CSS
  that coordinates the scroll-aware nav keeps working; their scripts are plain (no framework).
- **Design tokens** — restyle the whole site from `src/styles/tokens.css` (colors, fonts, the
  `--font-body`/`--font-display` pair, and the content-column width).
- **Social share image** — the link preview on iMessage/WhatsApp/etc. features the first
  testimonial (by carousel order), generated as a 1200×1200 JPEG (Sharp, face-aware crop). Flip
  `RANDOMIZE_OG_IMAGE` in `src/config.ts` to feature a random volunteer per build. See `src/lib/og.ts`.

---

## Deployment & CI

- **Cloudflare Pages**: build command `npm run build`, output dir `dist/`. Every push to `main`
  deploys. **Build cache is enabled** (project → Settings → Build → Build cache), which persists
  `node_modules` between deploys. This skips reinstalling Sharp and — because Astro caches every
  processed image in `node_modules/.astro` — only _changed_ photos are re-encoded. Adding one
  testimonial re-processes one image instead of all of them, so steady-state builds stay a few
  seconds rather than ~40. The source photos are 2000×3000, matching the largest variant we
  generate, so they're already right-sized — don't downscale them or the retina output softens.
- **Branch protection** (`main`): **block force pushes** and **block deletions** — the two things
  git can't easily recover from — are on. We deliberately do **not** require pull requests or
  reviews: Pages CMS and the GitHub web editor commit straight to `main`, and a review gate would
  add friction for non-technical editors without adding real safety. The safety net is layered
  instead: the content schema fails the build on a bad edit (so the last good site stays live),
  every edit is a revertable commit, and Cloudflare Pages keeps a one-click deployment rollback in
  its dashboard for the rare "that looks wrong, undo it now" moment.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): on each push/PR, runs Prettier check, `astro check`, and
  `astro build` — a broken change can't merge.
- **Git hooks** (`.githooks/`, zero-dependency, activated by `npm install` via the `prepare`
  script): **pre-commit** auto-formats staged files with Prettier so commits are always clean;
  **pre-push** runs the full CI locally (format + types + build) so `main` never goes red. Bypass
  either with `--no-verify`. Note: hooks only run on local `git` commits — edits via the GitHub web
  editor or Pages CMS skip them, so CI remains the real gate for content edits.
- **Dependencies** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly grouped update PRs. Merge them once CI is
  green. (TypeScript is held on the 5.x line until `astro check` supports TS 7.)
